# Changelog

Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/); while in `0.x`, a minor version may
change an interface and a patch never does. Apps pin a version through the submodule pointer.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-28

- `i18n.js`: the suite's own texts in English, Spanish, French and German (`i18n/`), language
  negotiation and a `t()` with placeholders, plurals and a fallback to English, key by key.
- `oauth.js`: `texts` is optional. Without it the consent and error screens use the suite's texts
  in the user's or the browser's language; `createTexts({ catalogs })` overrides some keys.
- `docs/architecture.md`: the target design of the platform and the order in which it is built.
- `CONVENTIONS.md`: the rules every repository of the suite follows.
- Tests run with `node --test`.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-09-27

- License: AGPL-3.0-only. Versions up to 0.2.0 keep the MIT license they were published with.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-27

- `workos.js` and `workos-accounts.js`: accounts with WorkOS AuthKit (sign-up, 2FA, Google,
  single sign-on across apps) and AuthKit as the authorization server for the MCP.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-27

- `oauth.js`: built-in OAuth 2.1 authorization server for an app's MCP endpoint (PKCE S256, CIMD
  and dynamic registration, hashed and rotating tokens), so Claude or ChatGPT connect by pasting
  the URL.
